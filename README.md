## Setup

1. **Clone** this repository and open it in your IDE.
2. In the command line, run > `npm install`
3. Start the API with `npm run start:dev`
4. Open a shell in MongoDB Compass. Make sure to **use** the database you want. We suggest you create a new tickets database. Copy-paste the code from **setup.js** into the shell and run it. It adds seven documents to the tickets collection. This provides the starting data for the API.
5. Add a .env file in this folder (not in src). Set your MONGO_URL and PORT there.
